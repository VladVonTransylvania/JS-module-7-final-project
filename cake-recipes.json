      "¼ tsp ground allspice"
    ],
    "Method": [
      "Put the butter, sugar, fruit, zests, juice and 100ml/3½fl oz brandy in a large pan. Bring slowly to the boil, stirring until the butter has melted. Reduce the heat and bubble for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.",
      "Remove the pan from the heat and leave to cool for 30 minutes.",
      "Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 150C/gas 2/ fan 130C and line a 20cm round cake tin. Toast the nuts in a dry frying pan, tossing them until evenly browned, or in the oven for 8-10 minutes - keep an eye on them as they burn easily. When they are cool, chop roughly. Stir the eggs, nuts and ground almonds into the fruit mixture and mix well. Sift the flour, baking powder and spices into the pan. Stir in gently, until there are no traces of flour left.",
      "Spoon the mixture into the tin and smooth it down evenly - you will find this is easiest with the back of a metal spoon which has been dipped into boiling water.",
      "Bake for 45 minutes, then turn down the heat to 140C/gas 1/ fan120C and cook for a further 1-1¼ hours (about a further 1¾ hours if you have a gas oven) until the cake is dark golden in appearance and firm to the touch. Cover the top of the cake with foil if it starts to darken too much. To check the cake is done, insert a fine skewer into the centre - if it comes out clean, the cake is cooked.",
      "Make holes all over the warm cake with a fine skewer and spoon the extra 4tbsp brandy over the holes until it has all soaked in. Leave the cake to cool in the tin. When it's cold, remove it from the tin, peel off the lining paper, then wrap first in baking parchment and then in foil. The cake will keep in a cupboard for up to three months or you can freeze it for six months."

    "Description": "Perfect & just the right size for just a little something sweet, especially at a xmas buffet/meal etc. Recipe worked perfectly for me & used a couple of times now, making my own gf madeira sponge. Can change it up by adding nuts etc onto the chocolate instead so handy little sweet bites with coffee etc. Love them.",
    "Author": "Caroline Hire",
    "Ingredients": [
      "200g madeira cake",
      "140g-160g white chocolate(see Tip)",
      "1 orange, zest finely grated",
      "300g dark chocolate, 60-70% cocoa solids, broken into chunks",
      "50g white chocolate, broken into chunks",
      "sugar holly decorations or red and green writing icing"
    ],
    "Method": [
      "Pulse the madeira cake in a food processor until you have fine crumbs. Melt the white chocolate in a bowl over just simmering water or in the microwave. Shop bought madeira cake can vary in texture so you may need to add a little extra melted white chocolate to make the mixture stick into balls. Stir the orange zest into the chocolate, then work the chocolate into the crumbs using your hands.",
      "Form into 10 small truffle-sized balls, then roll gently in your palms to smooth the surface. Arrange the balls on a baking parchment-lined dinner plate. Refrigerate for 30 minutes to allow the mixture to set.",
      "Melt the dark chocolate in a microwave or over a bowl of just simmering water. Dip a lolly stick into the melted chocolate about 1.5cm in and poke half way into a cake ball. Repeat with the remaining balls. Put them back on the plate. Return to the fridge for five minutes.",
      "Dip the cake pops one at a time into the melted chocolate, allowing any excess chocolate to drip off and spin the pops to even out the surface. Poke the pops into a piece of polystyrene or cake pop holder if you have one, keeping the pops apart. Allow to set for about half an hour.",
      "Heat the white chocolate in a microwave or over a pan of simmering water. Allow to cool for a few minutes until it has a thick, runny consistency. If the chocolate is too hot, it will melt the dark chocolate underneath so make sure you do not overheat it. Spoon a small amount on top of the cake pops and tip them back and forth so that it runs down the sides a little. If you have holly decorations, set one on each pop. If using writing icing, wait for another 20 minutes or so until the white chocolate has set. To avoid a bloom on the chocolate, cover the cake pops in chocolate on the day you want to eat them – or the day before at the earliest.",
      "Pipe on holly leaves with the green icing and two little dots for berries using the red. Once finished, store them in a cool place, though not the fridge"

Put the tin on a cooling rack and leave until warm.",

Cool completely, then remove the baking parchment, wrap loosely in clean baking parchment and store in an airtight tin. Feed the cake every week to 10 days until you decorate it.",

Lightly knead the marzipan and shape eight golf ball-sized balls. (You will have some left over – wrap up well for another time.) Using a rolling pin, gently roll the balls into flat circles, approx 1cm thick and the same diameter as the cakes. Sit the marzipan on the jammy side of the cakes. Do the same with the icing, brushing the marzipan with a little cooled, boiled water to help it stick.",
      "Beat the egg white until just frothy and broken up. Spread the caster sugar over a plate. Dip the cranberries and rosemary in the egg white, shake off the excess and roll in the caster sugar to create a frosty effect. Leave to dry for 15 mins. Tip away all but 2 tsp of the egg white and mix with the icing sugar to create a thick paste. Use to fix two cranberries and a sprig of rosemary to the top of each cake. Decorate with gold ribbon.

If you’ve made your cake a few weeks before you want to eat it, you can brush the cake with a little extra alcohol every week for up to 4 weeks. This will keep it moist and add flavour.",
      "To decorate the cake, brush all over with a little melted jam. Lightly dust your work surface with icing sugar and roll out the marzipan to a circle, large enough to cover the top and sides of the cake. Lift the marzipan by hanging it over the rolling pin and drape it over the cake. Smooth the marzipan down the sides of the cake, then trim away any excess from the bottom. Brush the marzipan all over with the remaining apricot jam, then roll out 1kg of the fondant icing and, using the same method as for the marzipan, cover your cake with the icing. Trim the edges and smooth out any marks with the palm of your hand, rubbing the icing to give it a shine.",
      "Knead the remaining icing, then cut off a small piece, about the size of a small marble, and set aside. Colour the large piece of icing with brown food colouring, adding a little at a time and kneading in well, until you have the desired colour. Divide the icing into 3, then shape a reindeer – body, head, 2 feet and a tail – from each piece. Mix 1 tbsp icing sugar with a tiny splash of water to use as a glue. Stick the head onto the body and squash down a little. Use a small knife to make three indents in the feet, then stick to the reindeer body, along with the tail.",

Poke half a pretzel into either side of the reindeers’ heads to create antlers.

Trim off excess using a sharp knife in a downward movement around the side of the cake.",

Place on a tray dusted with icing sugar. Make a smaller round and place on top, slightly offcentre. Continue to build up the tree, then top with a tiny paste cone. Repeat to make 7 trees in varying sizes. Leave to dry for several hours or overnight in a cool dry place. To make the icing, beat the egg whites with the lemon juice and glucose in a mixing bowl. Gradually sift in the icing sugar, beating all the time to make a stiff icing that forms peaks.",
      "Tie the ribbon round the cake. Thread a cocktail stick through a tree base, then thread on the tree, leaving a little of the stick showing at the base to attach to the cake. Swirl the icing thickly over the cake, forming peaks and teasing it over the sides. Stick the trees into the top of the cake and scatter over a handful of silver balls. Dust the trees thickly with icing sugar."

On a clean surface lightly dusted with a little sifted icing sugar, roll out the marzipan into a circle large enough to cover the cake – use a piece of kitchen string to help you check. Lift up the marzipan by hanging it over your rolling pin, then drape over the cake. Gently pat and smooth the marzipan down the sides of the cake, then trim any excess from the bottom.",
      "Repeat everything again with 900g of the ready-to-roll regal icing, firstly brushing the marzipan with more apricot jam. Trim the base as neatly as you can, then hide any rough bits by tying a pretty ribbon round the base. Dye the remaining 100g regal icing with a little red food colouring, then thinly roll out and stamp or cut out a few ‘H’ shapes. Dribble a little water into 50g sifted icing sugar to make a paste. Dot a little on the backs of the ‘H’ shapes and some round sweets, and stick around the top of the cake to make evenly spaced Ho, Ho, Hos."

      "Knead some green food colouring into the remaining icing and roll it out thinly on an icing-sugar-dusted surface. Stamp out lots of holly leaves and begin sticking them onto your iced cake. Use a paintbrush to moisten the underside of each leaf with a little water – don’t make them too wet though, or the green colour might leak onto the rest of the cake. When you have added enough holly leaves, mix a splash of water into some icing sugar to make a runny but fairly stiff icing, and use this to stick on your glitter berries. Leave the cake for a good couple of hours to dry before cutting into it. The cake will sit happily uncut for up to 2 weeks. Once cut into, keep in an airtight tin for up to a month."

      "Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and boil the kettle. First, make the chocolate cake. Liberally grease the bundt tin with butter, then dust with flour and shake out the excess. Put the cocoa in a bowl with a pinch of salt, cover with 150ml hot water from the kettle, mix until smooth, then set aside to cool. Put the butter and sugar in a bowl and whisk until light and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well between each addition. Sift in the flour and baking powder and fold everything together. Stir the soured cream into the cocoa mixture, then add to the other bowl and mix until just combined, then scrape into the prepared tin. Bake for 35 mins until a skewer comes out clean. Leave to cool for 15 mins in the tin, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.",
      "When the cake is cool, transfer to a baking sheet lined with baking parchment, and make space for the cake and tray in your freezer. Slice the cake into pieces roughly the thickness of your star cutter, then pull each piece out a little, so there is space around each one. Pop the cake in the freezer for 2 hrs, or overnight.",
      "When the cake is firmly frozen, lay each slice on its side, keeping them in the same circular pattern, and cut out a star, using the cutter, from the middle of each piece. Leftover cake can be kept in the freezer for up to 2 months, ready for making a trifle. Return the cut-out stars to the freezer.",
      "Now, make the peppermint cake. Grease the same bundt tin and heat your oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Put the butter and sugar in a bowl and beat until pale and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing well between each, then add the flour, soured cream and peppermint extract. Give everything a good mix and scrape half the mixture into the bundt tin. Remove the stars from the freezer and line up in a circle on top of the cake mixture (pointy sides up) – make sure there are no gaps and that the stars perfectly line up. Spoon the remaining cake mixture on top, easing it around the stars until they are just covered. Bake for 45 mins until risen and golden brown and a skewer poked into the side of the cake comes out clean. Cool in the tin for 10 mins, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.",
      "For the icing, melt the chocolate in short blasts in the microwave, or in a bowl suspended over a pan of barely simmering water, stirring it occasionally. Set aside to cool a little. In a large bowl, beat the icing sugar and butter until pale and smooth. Add the chocolate and peppermint extract, and mix again until combined. When the cake is completely cool, place on a serving plate, then swirl over the chocolate icing, easing it about halfway down the sides to create a snowy effect. Place the Maltesers on top of the cake. Will keep for up to 3 days in a sealed container."

Dissolve the sugar in the tea, add the whisky or orange juice, then spoon over the surface. If you’re making the cake ahead of time, feed it with a fresh swig of hot toddy every week, but take care not to make the cake soggy. Can be kept for a month well-wrapped in an airtight container in a cool, dry place. If short on time, the cake can be made the same day that you decorate it."

      "Lightly and evenly grease a 25cm bundt tin with soft butter, making sure you get well into any flutes or ridges. Sift 1 tbsp flour over the tin, then tilt and turn the tin until the inside is completely covered with a very thin layer of flour. Tap to gather any excess at the bottom a few times as you go. Once the butter is coated, tap and tip out the excess flour. Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.",
      "For the marzipan middle, dust the work surface with a little more flour, knead the marzipan briefly, then work in the cherries and orange zest. Roll into a sausage about 3cm thick, then press the ends together to make a ring.",
      "To make the cake, put the butter, flour, sugar, eggs, baking powder, almonds, spices and 1/4 tsp salt in a large bowl. Use an electric whisk to mix until smooth, then fold in the squash, fruit and walnuts.",
      "Spoon half the batter into the prepared tin, then press the ring of marzipan on top. Cover with the rest of the batter and smooth the top. Bake for 30 mins then – without opening the oven – reduce to 160C/140C fan/gas 3 and bake for another 30 mins. The cake will be risen, golden and shrunk away from the sides when it’s ready. Cool in the tin for 15 mins, then give the tin a sharp tap on the bottom before turning the cake out onto a cooling rack.",
      "To make the frosting, beat together half the cream cheese with the icing sugar and butter until evenly blended. When smooth, beat in the remaining cream cheese along with the milk and vanilla to make a thick, but still flowing, frosting – it should have a consistency similar to semi-whipped cream.",
      "When the cake is cold, spoon over the frosting, letting it drip down the sides. Sprinkle with a little cinnamon, then chill for 10 mins to set the frosting a little. Decorate with whole cherries and walnuts. Keep in the fridge and eat within 5 days."

      "large pinch mixed spice",
      "Brown, black, red, green and white ready-to-roll fondant icing"
    ],
    "Method": [
      "Butter and line 3 x 15 or 16cm round tins (alternatively do the baking in batches if you only have one tin). Heat the oven to 170C/150C fan/gas 3.",
      "Gently melt the chocolate, butter and sugar together in a large microwave-safe bowl on medium heat for a minute at a time, stirring until melted or, set a bowl over a pan of simmering water. Leave to cool a little.",
      "Beat together the eggs with the vanilla and soured cream in a bowl. Sift the flour, cocoa and baking powder into another bowl and whisk to distribute. Stir the egg mix into the cooled melted chocolate, then fold in the flour mix and fold through until all the powder has disappeared.",
      "Spoon a third of the mixture into each tin (if you weigh the tins, you can get it perfectly even and your cakes will cook at the same rate and to the same height). Level off each thin layer with the back of a spoon.",
      "Bake until just cooked, so when a skewer poked into the centre of the sponge layer comes out with a few crumbs and the cakes are shrinking away from the tin a bit. This will take about 25-30 mins, but check after 20 to be safe as all ovens vary. Remove and cool in the tins on a wire rack, or on top of cold oven hob rings.",
      "Meanwhile, to make the ganache, microwave all the ingredients together in 30 sec bursts until they have all melted, stirring at each interval. Or melt everything together in a bowl set over a pan of simmering water. Cool to room temperature before adding to the buttercream.",
      "To make the buttercream, beat the butter and vanilla paste until pale and creamy. Gradually add the icing sugar, beating well between each addition. (Using unrefined sugar will give the buttercream a natural caramel flavour.) Beat in the cooled ganache.",
      "To make the antlers, combine the sugar and butter with the vanilla paste until amalgamated but not creamed. Add the egg and combine. Mix the flour with the spices then tip that in and mix to form a dough. Wrap in cling film and chill in the fridge to firm up for 20 minutes. Roll out on a floured surface to a 5/6mm thickness. Lay the template on the dough and cut around it using a small sharp knife – make two sets in case of breakages (any additional dough can be saved). Push the lolly sticks up into the bottom of the antlers and bake for around 15-20 mins until cooked through and golden. Allow to cool.",
      "Make the ears by pulling a little of the brown fondant icing off the block and kneading it with white fondant icing to make a pale brown. Roll the rest of the dark brown icing out thickly on a surface dusted with icing sugar. Roll the paler icing out thinly. Cut large teardrop shapes from the lighter icing to form the ears (about 6cm in size) and stick the lighter shape on top of the darker icing with a little water. Cut a larger teardrop around the lighter shape. Fold and pinch together at the base, push a cocktail stick into the bottom of each one and set aside to firm up.",
      "Trim the cakes flat if they have a little hump where they have been baked. Put the first layer onto a 16cm cake board and use a little of the chocolate frosting to secure it to the board. Spread frosting over the first layer then add layer two. Sandwich together by pressing gently and add another layer of frosting to this layer. For the last layer, take the sponge and invert it on top of the other two cakes, so that the smooth part of the cake – that was on the bottom of the tin –becomes the top. This will make it nice and neat. Spread a very thin layer of icing over the whole cake to crumb coat it and chill to set for about 30 mins.",
      "Add more buttercream to the cake to make a clean top coat – use a palette knife or side scraper to get a smooth finish (but do save a little of the buttercream for the final flourish). Mark out the eyes with a cutter so you can see where to add them. Roll little strips of black fondant icing for the eyes and lashes, then stick these onto the cake. Mould the nose with red fondant icing and stick it on with a cocktail stick, pushing one end into the nose and the other into the cake.",
      "For the little collar, roll out about 100g of green fondant icing on a surface dusted with icing sugar and cut a thin strip for the bow that will fit around the base of the cake. Stick the ends together with a little water, then make a bow by folding another thin strip and stick this onto the collar with another dab of water. Scoop the leftover buttercream into a bag with a large star nozzle. Pipe some fluffy reindeer hair on top of the cake, then add the ears and biscuit antlers, pushing them in gently but firmly."

Butter and base-line a deep loaf tin (22 x 11 x 6cm). Put the chocolate and butter for the cake in a saucepan. Mix the coffee with 50ml water, then pour into the pan.

    "Author": "Sarah Cook",
    "Ingredients": [
      "85g apricot jam",
      "100g sifted icing sugar, plus extra for dusting",
      "750g marzipan",
      "2kg ready-to-roll regal icing",
      "blue, brown, orange and green food colouring",
      "85g desiccated coconut",
      "a few whole cloves",
      "3 strawberrieslaces"
    ],
    "Method": [
      "ICE THE CAKE: Melt the apricot jam, then sieve and brush a little all over a 23cm cake (see Apricot & almond fruitcake recipe to the right of this recipe). On a clean surface lightly dusted with a little sifted icing sugar, roll out the marzipan to a circle large enough to cover the cake – use a piece of kitchen string to help you check. Lift up the marzipan by hanging it over your rolling pin, then drape over the cake. Gently pat and smooth the marzipan down the sides of the cake, then trim any excess from the bottom.",
      "Colour the regal icing with a little blue food colouring, then cover the marzipan using the same method as you covered the cake, firstly brushing the marzipan with more apricot jam. Trim the base.",
      "ADD SOME SNOW: Use your hands to roll two-thirds of the remaining regal icing into a long, thin sausage on an icing sugar-dusted surface. It should be long enough to go round the cake – use a piece of kitchen string to help you measure it. Use a rolling pin to roll the sausage into a strip about 5cm wide. Use a small, sharp knife to straighten one edge, and trim the other into a wiggly edge.",
      "Keep all the trimmings, and squash half into 2 wobbly circles for the snowmen to sit on. Brush the strip, circles and the very bottom edge of the cake with a little runny icing made with 100g sifted icing sugar and a splash of water. Scatter the desiccated coconut over the strip and circles, gently pressing to stick and cover. Starting with one end of the strip, stick it round the base of the cake. This can be a bit fiddly, so if you’re nervous, simply halve the icing from the start and do in 2 half-length strips, using a little more coconut to hide the joins on the cake.",
      "SHAPE THE SNOWMEN: Roll the remaining third of regal icing into 2 large balls, 2 medium balls and 2 small balls. Stick together, squashing slightly, into 2 snowmen. Brush 4 cocktail sticks with a little brown food colouring and stick into the snowmen for arms.",
      "ADD BUTTONS AND NOSES: Push a few whole cloves into one snowman as buttons. Use a little orange food colouring to dye a little of the strip trimmings, and shape a little around the pointy end of 2 cloves to look like carrot noses. Use another clove to make little holes where the noses will go, dab a bit of runny icing into the holes and stick on the noses, pushing them into the holes to help hold them.",
      "SMILEY FACES: Use a black or brown writing icing pen to dot on smiley mouths and eyes – I find it helps to mark tiny holes with the end of a cocktail stick first. It stops you making mistakes and helps the icing stay in place.",
      "MAKE THE HAT: Dye another lump of regal icing trimmings with food colouring (we used green). Shape most into a woolly hat shape, pressing a slight dip into the bottom with your thumb where it will sit on the snowman’s head. Roll a little ball to stick on top of the hat; attach it with more runny icing. Then roll and cut a thin strip to stick round the base of the hat. Use a cocktail stick to make markings like a woolly hat and rough up the ball on top. A little more runny icing will help it stick onto your snowman’s head.",
      "AND LASTLY, THE SCARF: Knot the strawberry laces together at one end. Tightly plait a 10cm length and knot at the end again. Using scissors, snip the ends, leaving about 1cm for tassels after the knot, then wrap around the neck of the other snowman. Sit the wobbly snowy islands on top of the cake and a snowman on each one."

Chill in the freezer for 10 mins or in the fridge for 1 hr until set.",
      "Meanwhile, put the hemisphere sponge on the smaller cake board and halve horizontally. Fill the middle with some buttercream, sandwich with the top and coat the entire cake in a thin layer of buttercream. Chill in the freezer for 5 mins or in the fridge for 30 mins.",
      "Take the larger cake out of the fridge/ freezer and coat in another layer of buttercream. Take care when covering this time, as you want a smooth finish to the cake. Running the palette knife under hot water helps smooth over the sides once it is coated completely. Chill again for 5 mins in the freezer.",
      "Cover the hemisphere sponge with buttercream and smooth over with the palette knife. Carefully lift the hemisphere onto the centre of the cake (as the sponge has been frozen you shouldn’t leave finger marks). Press down lightly to set on the buttercream. If there is a gap around the rim, use a small palette knife to fill in with any remaining buttercream. Chill for 10-15 mins.",
      "Meanwhile, make the eyes and nose using coloured fondant. Roll the black fondant into two balls for the eyes, and five smaller balls for the mouth. Roll the orange fondant into a carrot shape. Leave to set and harden slightly while you make the drippy ganache.",
      "Make the drippy ganache by mixing the chocolate and oil and microwaving for 30 secs, stirring and then giving it another 30 secs until melted. Transfer to a squeezy bottle, then pour down the edges of the round cake to create the melting snow effect.",
      "To finish the cake, stick the eyes to the head using a little remaining buttercream. Poke the wooden dowel into the carrot nose, leaving some poking out to stick it to the face. Stick the five small black fondant balls for the mouth and the chocolate buttons down the front of the cake for buttons. Insert the Mikado sticks on either side for the arms. Bring the cake to room temperature before serving."

      "To make the cake, soak the apricots in the brandy while you get everything prepared. Heat oven to 160C/fan 140C/gas 3. Butter then line the sides and base of a deep 20cm round cake tin with greaseproof paper. Mix together the figs, raisins, cherries, nuts and lemon zest.",
      "Combine the flour with the baking powder, mixed spice and ground almonds. Beat the butter and sugar in a large bowl until creamy, about 2 mins. Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Gently fold the flour mixture into the cake mixture in two goes, then fold in the fruits and nuts, followed by the apricots and brandy.",
      "Spoon the mixture into the tin, then smooth the top, making a slight dip in the middle. Bake for 30 mins, then lower the temperature to 150C/fan 130C/gas 2 and bake for another 1 hr 45 mins, laying a sheet of foil loosely over the top for the final 15 mins if it starts to brown too quickly. The cake is done when a skewer inserted in the centre comes out clean. Leave the cake in the tin to cool, then remove the lining paper and wrap well in cling film and foil until ready to decorate (see below or turn the page for another idea).",
      "To create the frosty forest cake: colour the marzipan pale green with a little of the food colouring. Cut off 250g, then make this a shade darker with more food colouring for the trees. To make the trees, roll out the darker green marzipan on a surface lightly dusted with icing sugar. Make pointed triangular cardboard tree templates in 3 different sizes (roughly 7.5 x 4cm/6.5 x 3.5cm/5.5 x 3cm). Using these as guides, cut out the tree shapes (see tip, above right). Brush one side lightly with honey, then scatter over silver and coloured dragees, pressing them down lightly to stick. Lay the trees on baking parchment to firm up. This is best done a day or two ahead.",
      "When ready to decorate, sit the cake on a board or plate. On a surface lightly dusted with icing sugar, roll the paler green marzipan into a circle wide enough to cover the cake completely. Brush the cake all over with honey. Using a rolling pin, lift and lower the marzipan onto the cake. Smooth the surface of the marzipan with your palms, then trim off any excess from the bottom with a sharp knife.",
      "Cut off two-thirds of the ready-to-roll icing, then roll out a strip about 8cm wide and long enough to go over the top and down the sides of the cake. Cut a wavy line down either side to resemble a path. Brush the marzipan with honey where you want the path to go, then lay the path on top. Trim to neaten the ends.",
      "Take two-thirds of the remaining icing, then roll out 2 long, narrow ropes the same length as the path and about 5mm wide. Dampen the path edges with water and lay the ropes in position. Cut off and roll small pieces from the rest of the icing (and any trimmings), then shape into small snow drifts for the trees to stand in. When the trees are firm, make an indent in the top of each snowdrift with the back of a knife and put each tree into position. Sit the trees on the cake, securing with a little honey underneath. If necessary, cut off some of the rope along the edge of the path to make a flatter surface for the trees. Finally, scatter edible glitter onto the marzipanned cake."

      "Pour the remaining icing into a piping bag fitted with a small nozzle, or a sandwich bag and snip off the end – if the icing is a little runny, thicken it with extra icing sugar first. Use the icing to pipe a smiley face, eyes and 2 dots in the middle of each gingerbread man – stick edible gold balls on the dots to make buttons."

    "Name": "Butternut, chestnut & lentil cake",
    "url": "https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/butternut-chestnut-lentil-cake",
    "Description": "A healthy meal but not worth the effort to make. I totally agree with the other user: This was bland and fairly tasteless. Having read Kiwitifosi's review, I even added smoked paprika, nuts, caramelised onions and a layer of roasted butternut squash under the thin slices on the top. This was all in vein as it was still not great - too many lentils and chestnuts.",
    "Author": "Sarah Cook",
    "Ingredients": [
      "1 large butternut squash",
      "3 tbsp sunflower oil, plus extra for greasing",
      "3 onions, chopped",
      "15g pack of sage, 12 leaves reserved, rest finely chopped",
      "2 sprigs rosemary, leaves stripped and chopped, plus a few springs to serve",
      "3 garlic cloves, crushed",
      "1 tsp ground mace",
      "2 tbsp ground chia seedsor linseeds (flaxseeds)",
      "2 x 200g packs cooked chestnuts",
      "2 x 400g cans brown lentils, rinsed and drained",
      "200g wholemeal vegan breadcrumbs",
      "3 tbsp rapeseed oil"
    ],
    "Method": [
      "First, use a veg peeler to peel the butternut squash and heat oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Then using, a large, sharp knife cut a few 1cm thick ring-slices from the bulbous end, and a few small solid slices from the top end. Set aside the slices, and dice the rest into 1-2cm chunks. Toss the chunks with 1 tbsp of the sunflower oil on a baking parchment-lined tray and roast for 20-30 mins until tender and golden.",
      "Meanwhile prepare the tin. It’s worth taking some time to do this, as it’ll be the top of your cake in the end – and the bit you want to look impressive! Line the base of a deep, round, 25cm tin with a sheet of baking parchment. Brush the new base and sides with some oil, then start to arrange the rings in the base. You want to get in as many as you can, overlapping a bit like the Olympic rings. Snuggle in as many flat as you can, then sit your overlapping ones on top, cutting out bits of the squash, so they’ll also sit flat too. Any leftover trimmings, put in a microwave-proof bowl with a splash of water, cover with cling film and microwave on High at 2 min intervals until tender – around 5-6 minutes.",
      "In a separate pan, soften the onion in the last 2 tbsp of sunflower oil, over a very low heat so it doesn’t brown. Stir in the chopped sage, half the rosemary, and the garlic and mace, and cook for another few mins until fragrant. Mix the ground chia seeds or linseeds with 4 tbsp of water, and set aside with the cooling onions, until gluey.",
      "Meanwhile, roughly chop half the chestnuts but keep them chunky. Put the other half in a food processor with half the lentils, the microwaved squash and one-third of the roasted squash. Pulse to a mashed mixture. Tip this into a large mixing bowl with the softened onions, breadcrumbs, ground seed mixture and 1 tsp salt. Mash everything together really well to thoroughly mix, then more gently stir in the chopped chestnuts, followed by the whole lentils, and finally the remaining roasted squash chunks. Carefully press this mixture around and over the squash rings in the prepared tin. Level off the top, making sure it is tightly packed, then cover with foil. ",
      "To bake, heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Put the cake (still foil covered), into the oven on a middle shelf and bake for 1 hr.",
      "To serve, heat the rapeseed oil in a small frying pan and sizzle the reserved sage leaves with the remaining rosemary sprigs for a minute. Loosen around the sides of the cake with a round-bladed knife, then sit a serving plate inverted on top, and carefully flip the plate to turn out the cake. Spoon over the sizzled sage and rosemary leaves and herby oil, and serve at the table – for cutting into wedges in front of everyone."

Spoon into the tin, spread to level and bake for 50 mins until a poked-in skewer comes out clean. Remove from the oven and leave to cool for 10 mins in the tin, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.",
      "To decorate, first roll the marzipan into a sausage shape long enough to sit on top of the cake in a ring. Position it on top and squeeze the two ends together, then press down a little to help it stick in place. Mix the fondant icing sugar with enough water to make a thick but spreadable icing – add the water little by little, so you don’t end up with a really runny icing. Spoon the icing over the marzipan ring, letting it dribble down the sides a little. Shape the Regal-Ice Icing into holly leaves and dust with green glitter or press on green sprinkles. Arrange on top of the cake, using the whole glacé cherries as the berries."

Use the remaining icing to stack the cakes and cover the entire outside in a thin layer – don’t worry about making the cake look too neat at this stage, as any crumbs trapped in the icing will be covered in the final coat.

Butter the outside of the can and wrap in non-stick baking paper. Fill the can one-third full with baking beans, rice or dried pulses (to weigh it down), then position in the middle of the tin.

Brush the top of the cake with jam, then put it, jam side down, on the marzipan.",

Spread over the marzipan with a palette knife, then decorate the top with cranberries, bay leaves and the frosted eucalyptus sprigs. Leave to set overnight before cutting.

    "Name": "Prosecco cake",
    "url": "https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/prosecco-cake",
    "Description": "After reading the comment that the cake was bland, I soaked the sponge with a few tbsp of prosecco syrup after cooling it down (boil a half pint of prosecco with ca. 300g sugar and a vanilla pod until thickened, add lemon juice and rose water to taste) and I think that did the trick, the flavour came through nicely. I also left out the sweets for decoration and replaced it with raspberries; you'll need lots of tart berries to balance the mountains of butter cream.\nIt turned out a very heavy cake. I would make it again, however, I will probably use less butter cream next time and maybe put some lemon in it as well as it's just too much of a good thing.",

    "Ingredients": [
      "350g unsalted butter, plus a little for the tins",
      "350g golden caster sugar",
      "6 eggs",
      "350g self-raising flour",
      "100ml prosecco",
      "100g raspberry jam",
      "300g unsalted butter, softened",
      "600g icing sugar",
      "100ml prosecco",
      "sprinkles, coloured sugar, mini meringues, Prosecco-flavoured sweets, popcorn and lollies"
    ],
    "Method": [
      "Heat oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3. Butter the inside of 2 deep, loose bottomed 21cm tins. Cream the butter and sugar together with electric beaters until it is light and fluffy, then gradually beat in the eggs a little at a time. Fold in the flour and a pinch of salt, don’t worry if the mixture look like it has split, it will come back together when the flour is added. Pour in the Prosecco and stir until smooth.",
      "Spoon the mixture into the tins, level the top and bake for 45-50 mins or until the cakes are well-risen and golden and a skewer inserted comes out clean. Leave to cool in the tin for 10 minutes and then turn them out onto a rack.",
      "While the cakes cool, make the icing. Beat the butter with the icing sugar until it is smooth. Add the Prosecco and beat again until the frosting is fluffy and smooth. ",
      "Level the cakes if you need to and spread the raspberry jam on one of the cakes followed by some of the butter cream, sandwich the other cake on top. Roughly ice the cake all over in a very thin layer with a couple of tablespoons of buttercream, this will help all the crumbs stick to the cake and help make the outer layer of icing nice and clean. Ice the cake all over with the remaining buttercream, this can be quite rough because you are going to stick sweet all over it. Now stick sweets all over it. Go mad. Drink Prosecco with it."

    "Name": "Potato cakes with smoked salmon & cream cheese",
    "url": "https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/potato-cakes-smoked-salmon-cream-cheese",
    "Description": "I made this for a Christmas party and the finished canapés looked amazing. It was interesting to make the potato farl from scratch, but I'm not convinced I'd bother again and perhaps would just buy some blinis or something similar. I found I needed to whip the cheese mixture for quite a while after the addition of the lemon and cream otherwise it would have been liquid. I thought the cheese ended up a bit too lemony, so if I made it again I'd just put the zest on top and skip the juice.",
    "Author": "Miriam Nice",
    "Ingredients": [
      "1kg baking potatoes",
      "100g butter, melted",
      "100g plain flour, plus extra for dusting",
      "1 tsp bicarbonate of soda",
      "280g tub full-fat cream cheese",

      "50g caperberries, halved"
    ],
    "Method": [
      "Heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Prick the potatoes all over with a fork, then bake whole for 1 hr 20 mins or until crisp on the outside and fluffy inside. Set aside on a wire rack to cool. Reduce oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.",
      "Once the potatoes are cool enough to handle, cut in half and scoop out the flesh into a large bowl, discarding the skins. Mash the potato really well, then mix in two-thirds of the melted butter, all the flour and the bicarbonate of soda. Season well.",
      "Line a large (approx 35 x 25cm) baking tray with a piece of baking parchment and brush with half the remaining butter. Roll out the potato dough on a floured surface, then lay it on the lined baking tray – don’t worry if it breaks, just push the pieces back together once on the tray. Brush the dough with the remaining melted butter and bake for 45 mins or until golden brown on the outside.",
      "Remove from the oven and allow to cool on the tray. Meanwhile, put the cream cheese in a large bowl and whisk until smooth and light. Stir in the double cream and lemon juice, and season well with black pepper. Spread the cream cheese mixture all over the surface of the cooled potato cake. Use a large, sharp knife to cut the potato cake into 30 squares, then top with the strips of salmon, the dill fronds, caperberries and lemon zest. Transfer to a serving platter and serve."
